  Ask Congress to vote on the bipartisan <strong>Sunshine Protection Act</strong>.
</summary>
We need your return (full) address to find your representatives. We do provide a custom letter if one of your reps (house and senators) already supports the bill. Otherwise they get a letter that's asking them to please support it.

<p>Please don&#39;t blame the farmers! They had nothing to do with making the clocks change. Read more from the <a href="https://www.fb.org/viewpoints/setting-the-record-straight-daylight-saving-time-and-farmers" target="_blank">Farm Bureau</a>.</p>

<p>The #LockTheClock campaign has a <a href="https://www.sco.tt/time/research.html" target="_blank">good page that safety aspect</a></p>
<h1 id="-energy-use-">... energy use?</h1>
<p>It has been shown to not save energy and possibly use more. Lighting savings are more than offset by higher heater/cooling usage.</p>

<p>Changing the clocks is <a href="https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/10/31/how-daylight-saving-time-affects-health/" target="_blank">bad for our health (Snopes)</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher risk of heart attack, strokes, and other health issues</li>
<li>Major mental heal</li>
<li>More accidents and it has not saved any energy in decades. </li>
