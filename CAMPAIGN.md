Title: Write to Congress for permanent Daylight Saving Time
Default Subject: Support the Sunshine Protection Act

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?  | Also Default Message

Please support the Sunshine Protection Act to make Daylight Saving time (Summer time) permanent.

Changing the clocks disrupts our lives and has been shown to increase risk of heart attack, strokes, and other health issues.  It has been shown to cause more accidents and it has not saved any energy in decades.

Giving us an extra hour of sunlight at the end of the day can help us get more exercise and spend more time outside.

Thank you!
