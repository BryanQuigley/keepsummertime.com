Are you tired of having to switch your clocks?

We have a choice to be on 
 * Standard time (more daylight in the morning) - 4 months of the year right now.
 * Daylight Saving Time (summer time or more daylight in the afternoon).  It seems the majority of us want more time in the afternoon and no time change.  This used to be less than the "standard" time but we keep increasing it.

Let's just keep the clocks on the schedule from the summer!  The bipartisan Sunshine Protection Act does just that. States or territories that don't follow DST currently are not impacted.

I will never ask for money as part of this campaign - just actions that I think will help.I may send out 1 "Thank you" message if this is successful which could mention other campaigns.  After that 1 email all the data will be deleted.
