# Privacy | What does this form do?
It contacts your representatives in congress via their contact forms. We need your return/full address to know your representatives. We give you a letter to customize including a thank you if one of your reps already supports the bill.

I will only use your information or contact you for this campaign.  Delete your  information if the campaign stops or within 1 year of a successful switch. Send out only one "Thank you" message if this is successful which could mention other campaigns.

I will ***never***, ask for money, sell your information, or sign you up for other mailing lists.
