Are you tired of having to switch your clocks? Let's #LockTheClock!

| ☀️ Daylight Saving Time | "Standard" Time   |
--- | --- |
| Summer Time, Most of Fall and Spring | Winter Time | 
| More daylight at end of day  | More daylight at start of day |
| 8 months of the year| Only 4 months of the year - used to be more |

# Changing the clocks disrupts our lives
 * Higher risk of heart attack, strokes, and other health issues
 * More accidents and it has not saved any energy in decades. 
 * It doesn't save energy!
