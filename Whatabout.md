# ... farmers?
Please don't blame the farmers! They had nothing to do with making the clocks change. Do farm animals care what time it is? Read more from the [Farm Bureau](https://www.fb.org/viewpoints/setting-the-record-straight-daylight-saving-time-and-farmers).

# ... kids going to school in the dark?
The #LockTheClock campaign has a [good page that covers the safety aspect](https://www.sco.tt/time/research.html)

# ... energy use?
It has been shown to not save energy and possibly use more.

# ... our health?
Changing the clocks is bad for our health:
 * Higher risk of heart attack, strokes, and other health issues
 * Major mental health
 * More accidents and it has not saved any energy in decades. 

 # ... "standard" time?
 It's no longer really standard as we are on DST for longer then "standard" time. Regardless, states are currently allowed to switch to "Standard time" all year long. They can't choose to be on summer time/permanent DST, but 15 states would prefer to be!

# ... the specific bill(s)
They are currently tracked separately in the [house](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/69/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded) and [senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/623/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded).

You can also learn more from this [PDF summary](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/14e39e20-b852-4cae-b98b-258e0c0898a6/1C912A264D838911D32528FA5B1FD0FB.sunshine-protection-act-2019-one-pager.pdf) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Protection_Act).

I usually say "For the USA - Congress can change this and there is already a bipartisan bill that does.  Ask them to pass it at keepsummertime.com (for permanent DST)."
