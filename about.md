## What About...

### farmers?

Please don't blame the farmers! They had nothing to do with making the clocks change. Do farm animals care what time it is? Read more from the [Farm Bureau](https://www.fb.org/viewpoints/setting-the-record-straight-daylight-saving-time-and-farmers).

### energy use?
It has been shown to not save energy and possibly use more.

### our health?
Changing the clocks is bad for our health:
 * Higher risk of heart attack, strokes, and other health issues
 * Major mental health
 * More accidents and it has not saved any energy in decades. 


### didn't it pass?
Here is the current status.

The [house](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/139/cosponsors) version is currently at 13 co-sponsors (all Republicans)

The [senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/29/cosponsors) version is currently at 16 co-sponsors (8 D, 8 R)

Here are how we did in old sessions, the bills need to be re-introduced.

The [house](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/69/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded) version was introduced by Rep. Buchanan, Vern and currently got to 48 co-sponsors (32 R, 16 D) but never got called up for a vote on the floor.

The [senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/623/cosponsors?searchResultViewType=expanded) version was introduced by Sen. Rubio, Marco and got to 18 co-sponsors (10 R, 8 D) and passed the Senate!.

### "standard" time?
 It's no longer really standard as we are on DST for longer then standard time. Regardless, states are currently allowed to switch to Standard time all year long. They can't choose to be on summer time/permanent DST unless congress acts!

### the current bill(s)
It's called the Sunshine Protection Act and it has been introduced in both the house and senate.

The [house](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1279) version was introduced by Rep. Buchanan, Vern and currently has 19 co-sponsors (19 R).

The [senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/582) version was introduced by Sen. Rubio, Marco and currently has 14 co-sponsors (7 R, 7 D).
